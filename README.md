# bc-hiking
A demo/hobby web application for uploading and commenting on local hiking trails.

This web application was made by a student following Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp", for the purpose of education and demonstration.

It was made primarily using the MEAN stack. However, Angular.js was not used.

For the front end, it used HTML5, JavaScript with jQuery and DOM Manipulation, and CSS with Bootstrap.

For the back end, it used Node.js with RESTful routing and CRUD principles.

The Server framework was done with Express.js, while MongoDB, with Mongoose (Object Data Modeling library) was used for the Database.

The project was mainly completed on the cloud IDE service goormIDE.

Heroku was used for the dedicated server, as well as MongoDB Atlas for the dedicated database.

Git and the command line were also used during development.
